# MassDropERC721

## Overview

MassDropERC721 is a modern, minimalist, and gas-efficient ERC-721 implementation that introduces a novel design allowing deployers to mass mint tokens to specified addresses during deployment. This eliminates the need to individually call the contract to mint each token, making the distribution process more efficient.

The MassDropERC721 contract complies with the ERC-721 standard, providing a secure and interoperable token interface.

Deployers can leverage the mass minting feature by providing a list of addresses during contract deployment. Each address in the list will receive a unique token.

## Features

- **Mass Minting:** The contract supports mass minting of tokens to specified addresses during deployment.
- **Gas Efficiency:** The implementation focuses on minimizing gas consumption for improved cost-effectiveness.
